Sweet Pea is the build tool for Open Social themes and modules. Using a single 
build tool provides consistent output and capabilities for all themes and 
modules.

global dependency on your system.

## Usage

In the below examples we use [npx](https://github.com/zkat/npx) to run commands 
from the Sweet Pea package without a full path. Alternatively you can add the 
commands to the `scripts` object of your package.json file without `npx` prefix
and execute the commands using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
